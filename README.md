# Login Interface using Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4.
You can sign up and login through mocking data(a real database can be implemented).

## Development server

Run `ng s -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Modifying

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Login

You can use mocking data from `src/lib/services/user.service.ts` to test the login page,<br
